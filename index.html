        Before starting, I will give you small details about Ayurveda before 6000 years ago an Indian rushi name
        'Patanjali' who is also a founder of yoga and Ayurveda. He write a book called 'Ayurved sanhita' and he put all
        details of the surgery and all Ayurveda Gyan in on the book. In 600AD Vagbhata simplify all details of
        Patanjali's 'Ayurvdsanhita' book. Vagbhata spends all his life researching and simplifying Patanjali formulas
        and write the great book 'Ashtanga hrudayam'. Vagbhata lives for 100+ years without any illness and he took
        samadhi. Now, you are thinking how I know all this I watch a YouTube video of 'Rajiv Dixit who is a social

    <h2>
        rules:
    </h2>

    <p class="text">
        Rule no.1)  Never drink cold water because when it goes to your stomach it cold your stomach and after that it
        cold your heart and if you drink too much cold everyday geeting your chances of getting heart attack will become
        high if you dont beliver google it.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.2) Always drink water which is in Matka,maath which make of mitti kumbhar made matkas from special
        mitti. I dont know much about this point but our ancisters drink water in only Tambya and Mattka.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.3) Did you see how other animals drink water by toungue right there very few animals who drink like us
        the thing here is we also need to drink water slowly and by sip sip and you need to hold a sip of water for 1 to
        2 sec let little salivy to be mix in water then drink it.

    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text">
        Rule no.4) While eating food alway sit in Sukhasan, before eating anthing never drink water juat before taking
        food in, chew food more than 32 times and the main rule never drink water after food. After 40 min of taking
        your food you allow to drink water there is so much science behind this if I tell this blog bwcone roo long.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.5) It will offend you but never use colgate. In US dental problem are on there pick you will not believe
        but its because of colgate. And after colgate comes to India same thing happning here my Dadi never use any
        paste he use 'dantamanjan or sometimes babul,neem ki kadi' I also using this. The reason behind this is in
        morning our teeth need salty or kavat flavour to keep teeeth fresh but colgate has all opposite of it. Always
        wast mouth after you eat food.

    </p>

    <br>

    <p class="text">
        Rule no.6) Whenever you get headech,cold,cough or fever take large glass of wateror milk, boil it mix little
        amount of haldi in it and mix properly and drink it by sip sip do this 3 times a day morning,evining and before
        sleep you will get relif in one or sometime in 2 day. I always do this and I become well in between 2 to 3 days.
        Never tak Paracitamol guys its very dangerous ita ban in many countris and there are so many medicines like that
        make your own reserch before taking any medicine.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.7) Go and search after reading this blog about 'Dr.Bishwaroop Roy Choudhari DIP diet' and you will get
        tons of video this diet can cure 'cold fever to sugur,diabitie even this doctor saves paralized and cancer
        patient' must google this is Gold mine for me.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.8) Yog, Pranayam, Gym or Meditation do anything from this but do meditation daily for atlist 10 min it
        will gave you amazing concentration power. Other are optional depend on you. But,remeber Swami Vivekanada play
        football with his shishya say maintaining you body is also important beacuse it will be with you tilk your
        death.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Rule no.9) When you eat food in afternoon after than you need to do Vajrasan it helps food to digest fast.
        Mahatma Gandhi always seats in Vajrasan some people says he sit in Vajrasana for 3 to 4 hours staight. Do
        Vajrasana for 10 min or depending on your potential and then take a small 20 to 40 hours slip. Dont do hard task
        in afternnon beacuse in afternnon your blood pressure is always on high and in night your blood presure become
        low so when you done with night food atleast walk 1000 steps and do Vajrasana dont directly sleep after taking
        food it will deatroy your health digestive problem, heart pain, gas so please follow this.

    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Role no.10) Whenever you get julab or loose motion take 1 full spoon Jeera and chew it when you feel I cant chew
        more than this then drink that chewed jeera with water instant relif no need to take any medicine.

        Last and important tip - Try to drink water in Tambya/Bronze its metal if you hold water in it and drink it its
        so so healthy. Never use iodanize salt its not healhy balck solt is option instead of that. If you eat small
        amount of gul after food its very effective for good digesrion. Try to avoid sugar intake. Wash fruit and
        vegitable in water with baking soda. Try to use organic food. Make sure you search about 'Rajiv dixit' and
        'Dr.Bishwaroop Roy Choudhari'. These people Have the power to change your life.

        never get ill there are only 20% health problem which we cant handle we need doctor there like cancere, Bone
