        Before starting, I will give you small details about Ayurveda before 6000 years ago an Indian rushi name
        'Patanjali' who is also a founder of yoga and Ayurveda. He write a book called 'Ayurved sanhita' and he put all
        details of the surgery and all Ayurveda Gyan in on the book. In 600AD Vagbhata simplify all details of
        Patanjali's 'Ayurvdsanhita' book. Vagbhata spends all his life researching and simplifying Patanjali formulas
        and write the great book 'Ashtanga hrudayam'. Vagbhata lives for 100+ years without any illness and he took
        samadhi. Now, you are thinking how I know all this I watch a YouTube video of 'Rajiv Dixit who is a social worker and so
        famous from 1990 to 2010 all my gyan will be in front of you and if you follow this you will never get ill because I am practising this from 3 to 4 year and I only get cold once or twice in year
        which is normal and I never take any medicine, I didnt even meet our family doctor from last 3 to 4 years.
